ChromaDB Sailing Knowledge Base - Vector Database Intro

This script demonstrates the core concepts of a vector database using ChromaDB.
It builds a small sailing knowledge base by storing text documents as vector
embeddings, then performs semantic similarity searches against them.

Key concepts covered:
  - Creating and persisting a ChromaDB collection
  - Using ChromaDB's built-in embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via onnxruntime)
    to automatically convert text into vector embeddings on insert and query
  - Performing a similarity search using natural language and interpreting
    the distance scores returned (lower = more similar)
